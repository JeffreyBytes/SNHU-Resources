## The Organic Chemistry Tutor

I've found [The Organic Chemistry Tutor](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheOrganicChemistryTutor) YouTube channel to be a useful resource. If I have the time I'll add links to specific videos in each module, but for now I'll just link to the channel.

## OpenStax Algebra & Trigonometry Recorded Lectures

This is a collection of full lectures and notes covering chapeters 6-10 of the OpenStax Algebra and Trigonometry book. They aren't the best quality videos, but the content is good if you're looking for a more traditional lecture style.

Because there are many videos I've outlined them [here](openstax-lectures.md).
